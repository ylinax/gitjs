# Issue Management

To help keep the open issues representative of the most relevant and active set of issues with
this project and its users there are some automated processes you may see interacting with
your issues or pull requests:

## Automated "No Response" Closures

Any issues where the project maintainers ask for more detail will automatically be closed after a
set time unless the additional detail has been supplied.

> My issue has been closed, but I now I have the extra detail

If the issue has been closed but not locked, you can re-open the issue and add your additional
detail.

If the issue has been locked, create a new issue and link the old one by its ID or URL if it is
still relevant. 

> Why close issues in this way?

To keep the most relevant issues visible, historical issues that aren't being actively investigated
lose their relevance as the library's implementation moves on, bugs get fixed and documentation
improves.
